## In Progress

### Phase 7: Production-Grade GPS Tracking
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Commit:** 0f81698
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Implemented:**

*7A — Tracking Domain:*
- `src/types/tracking.ts`: TrackingSession, TrackPoint, TrackingStatistics, SyncState, TrackFilterConfig with strict types (no `any`)
- `src/lib/domain/tracking/reducer.ts`: pure session state machine (idle → acquiring → tracking → paused → stopping → completed/error), safe against duplicate START/FINISH events
- `src/lib/domain/tracking/statistics.ts`: distance (Haversine), moving/elapsed time from timestamps, avg/current speed, elevation gain/loss/min/max; honest "unavailable" elevation when altitude is absent

*7B — Browser Geolocation Engine:*
- `src/lib/tracking/geolocation.ts`: single-watcher guarantee, watchPosition lifecycle, permission-denied/timeout/unavailable handling, cleanup on stop/dispose

*7C — GPS Quality Filtering:*
- `src/lib/domain/tracking/filtering.ts`: rejects invalid coordinates, duplicates, stale timestamps, severe accuracy, impossible jumps and speed spikes; configurable via DEFAULT_TRACK_FILTER

*7D — Durable Local Persistence:*
- `src/lib/tracking/storage.ts` + `persistence.ts`: IndexedDB (via a small adapter, MemoryDb fallback for tests) storing sessions and all route points; survives refresh/restart for resumable sessions

*7E — Synchronization:*
- `src/lib/tracking/sync.ts`: background sync loop independent of GPS collection; explicit states (local/pending/syncing/synced/failed), retry with backoff, online/offline awareness
- `src/lib/tracking/supabaseSync.ts`: idempotent upsert into `route_points` keyed by client-generated `source_id`; browser (anon) client only, RLS-protected by trip ownership

*7F/G — Tracking UI & Map:*
- `/trips/[id]/track`: expedition-instrument UI (StatusIndicator, MetricReadout, TrackingControls, TrackingDashboard)
- `TrackingMap.tsx`: Leaflet/OpenStreetMap route polyline + live position marker; no hardcoded credentials
- Linked from trip detail page for active trips

*7H/I — Hardening & Tooling:*
- Start/pause/resume/finish race protection (start/finish locks), session restore on mount, network listeners with cleanup
- 60 unit tests (Vitest + fake-indexeddb): geo math, filtering, statistics, reducer lifecycle, geolocation, persistence, sync/retry/dedup
- Fixed 7 pre-existing lint errors (migrated to ESLint 9 flat config for eslint-config-next 16)

**Schema Change:**
- `route_points.source_id TEXT` + partial unique index `idx_route_points_source_id` (WHERE source_id IS NOT NULL)
- `supabase/migrations/0001_tracking_phase7.sql` for existing databases; primary schema updated

**Validation:**
- Lint: ✅ 0 errors (15 pre-existing warnings)
- Typecheck: ✅ PASS
- Tests: ✅ 60/60 (7 files)
- Build: ✅ PASS (Next.js 16.3.4, /trips/[id]/track included)
- Secrets: ✅ none committed (.env gitignored)

**Known Limitations:**
- No elevation correction (GPS altitude used as-is when available; UI shows "—" otherwise)
- Background tracking while the tab is fully closed is not possible in browsers; resumable sessions cover refresh/reopen
- Leaflet tiles require network; offline map tiles not yet cached
- Trip status is not auto-transitioned to completed on tracking finish (deliberate: user retains manual control)

**Next Milestone:** Phase 8 — Gear System

## PHASE 8 — GEAR SYSTEM (COMPLETE)

**Commit:** `16bf2e6` — feat: implement gear management system
**Remote:** origin/main = `16bf2e6`

### Architecture

**Data model decision — SNAPSHOT on assignment.**
When a gear template is assigned to a trip, item data is COPIED into
`trip_packing_items` (a new table). The source `template_id` / `source_item_id`
are stored as nullable provenance references (`ON DELETE SET NULL`), never as
live foreign-key dependencies for reads. Consequences:
- Later template edits can never corrupt a trip's historical packing state
- Deleting a template never destroys trip packing lists
- Re-assigning the same template is idempotent per `source_item_id` (dupes skipped)

### Schema changes (`supabase/migrations/0002_gear_system.sql`, mirrored in schema.sql)
- `gear_items.required BOOLEAN` + `gear_items.updated_at` + trigger
- New `trip_packing_items`: trip_id (CASCADE), provenance refs (SET NULL),
  item_name, category, quantity (CHECK >= 1), weight (grams/unit), notes,
  required, packed, packed_at, sort_order, timestamps
- Indexes on trip_id / category / packed
- Full RLS via trip ownership (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE+WITH CHECK/DELETE)
- Safe/idempotent for existing databases; preserves all data

### Domain layer (`src/lib/domain/gear/`)
- `progress.ts` — pure, deterministic: `computePackingProgress` (required vs
  optional split, quantity-weighted weight, percentage), `groupByCategory`
  (stable display order), `totalWeightOf`, `formatWeight` (never invents mass),
  `allRequiredPacked`, `remainingRequiredItems`, `isGearCategory`
- `validation.ts` — shared client+server rules: name lengths, quantity 1..999,
  weight 0..1,000,000 g, category guard, notes length; normalizers
  (`normalizeCategory/Quantity/Weight` — missing weight stays undefined)
- `tripPacking.ts` — `TripPackingService`: getPackingItems, assignTemplateToTrip
  (snapshot copy, idempotent), addPackingItem, setPacked, removePackingItem,
  clearPackingList, updatePackingItem, getPackingProgress, getProgressSummary
- `service.ts` — GearService extended with `required`, snapshot-friendly updates

### UI
- `/gear` — template list (existed, updated for new fields)
- `/gear/[id]` — template detail: add/delete items, required flag, quantity,
  weight, category select, delete template
- `/trips/[id]/pack` — flagship packing checklist: category groups (collapsible),
  sticky progress header, one-tap 56px-min pack/unpack with `useOptimistic` +
  rollback-on-failure, Req/Opt distinction, assign-template card, ad-hoc item form
- `/trips/[id]` — Gear card with live progress + "Continue packing" deep link

### Critical implementation notes
- Server actions MUST `revalidatePath` after toggle/remove: `useOptimistic`
  state is discarded when the transition completes, so without revalidation
  packed state visually reverts. Implemented and commented.
- Auth: every service call re-verifies `auth.getUser()`; RLS enforces trip
  ownership as the second layer. Cross-user access impossible via normal flows.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors (17 pre-existing warnings)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — pass
- `npx vitest run` — 87 tests / 9 files pass (27 new gear domain tests)
- `npm run build` — pass; routes: /gear, /gear/[id], /trips/[id]/pack
- Secrets scan — clean

### Known limitations
- Offline packing state changes are NOT queued; packing requires connectivity.
  Phase 7's IndexedDB sync infra could be extended, but Gear did not reuse it
  to avoid pretending offline safety that doesn't exist yet.
- Item reordering UI not exposed (sort_order supported in data/service).
- CRUD service tests require a live Supabase instance; domain logic (progress,
  validation, grouping, weight) is fully unit-tested instead.

**Next milestone:** Phase 10 — dashboards/analytics or export (owner's call).

---

## PHASE 9 — TRIP ROUTE HISTORY & STATISTICS (Complete)

**Commit:** ac5ffdd `feat: implement trip route history and statistics`

### Architecture
- **Pure domain module** `src/lib/domain/tracking/routeStats.ts`:
  `computeRouteStats(points)` → totalDistance (Haversine, rounded), elevationGain/Loss,
  max/min elevation, hasElevation, duration (from timestamps), averageSpeed, pointCount,
  startedAt/endedAt. No I/O — fully unit-tested (9 tests).
- **Correctness fixes over the old inline `calculateRouteStats`**:
  - altitude `0` is now treated as valid data (was discarded by falsy check)
  - min/max include the first point and single-point routes
  - elevation is honestly reported as "not available" when no altitude exists
    (previously fake 0s)
  - `TrackingService.calculateRouteStats` now delegates to the pure module.
- **Page** `/trips/[id]/route` (server component): loads route points via
  existing `TrackingService.getRoutePointsByTripId` (RLS via trip ownership),
  computes stats, renders:
  - static route map `src/components/tracking/RouteHistoryMap.tsx` — Leaflet/
    react-leaflet (same OSS choice as Phase 7, no API key), fits viewport to the
    route once, start (green) / end (amber) markers, no live-tracking behavior
  - stats grid: distance, elapsed time, average speed, point count, ascent,
    descent, highest/lowest point, elevation-data availability badge
  - empty state with pointer to the GPS tracker
- Trip detail page gained a "Route History" card linking to the new page.

### Reused (no duplication)
TrackingService route-point fetch, Haversine geo, tracking formatters
(`formatDistance/formatSpeed/formatTime/formatElevation`), Button/Card/Badge,
Phase 7 map stack and design language.

### Validation
- vitest: 96/96 (9 new routeStats tests)
- tsc --noEmit: clean
- lint: 0 errors
- production build: all routes present including `/trips/[id]/route`
- secrets scan: clean; pushed to origin/main and verified

### Known limitations
- No elevation-profile chart yet (ascent/descent/min/max only).
- No route export (GPX/CSV).
- Map tiles require network; no offline tile cache.

**Next milestone:** Phase 11 — or owner-directed work.

---

## PHASE 10 — ELEVATION PROFILE & GPX EXPORT (Complete)

**Commit:** 9c09c04 `feat: implement elevation profile and GPX export`

### Domain (pure, fully unit-tested)
- `src/lib/domain/tracking/elevation.ts` — `buildElevationProfile(points, sampleCount?)`:
  builds a distance-indexed altitude series from REAL recorded fixes only
  (no interpolation); honest `hasElevation` gate (needs ≥2 altitude fixes);
  downsample-capped samples (default 200); gain/loss over sampled series.
- `src/lib/domain/tracking/gpx.ts` — `buildGpx(points, {name, description})`:
  GPX 1.1 track document with metadata (name/desc/time/bounds), `<trk>/<trkseg>/<trkpt>`,
  XML-escaped metadata, `<ele>` omitted when altitude is absent, full precision coords
  (7 dp), ISO timestamps; `escapeXml`, `gpxFilename` (sanitized filename).

### UI
- `ElevationProfileChart.tsx` — dependency-free SVG area/line chart (keeps the
  bundle lean; no chart library), tabular-nums axis summary, `role="img"` +
  aria-label, plus an sr-only data table for screen readers.
- `GpxExportButton.tsx` — client-side Blob download from already-fetched route
  data (no extra server round-trip), error surfaced via `role="alert"`.
- `/trips/[id]/route` now shows the elevation profile section (only when real
  altitude exists) and the GPX export action.

### Validation
- vitest: 110/110 (14 new: elevation profile 7, GPX 7)
- tsc --noEmit clean; lint 0 errors; production build pass; pushed & verified.

### Known limitations
- Profile samples are recorded fixes only — very sparse altitude data yields a
  coarse profile (by design; we do not smooth or interpolate).
- GPX export is client-side; no server-side export history or email delivery.
- No offline tile cache for the map (unchanged from Phase 9).

| ElevationProfileChart was found corrupted (literal 	est) and restored in fix commit 62b59cd.

## PHASE 11 — TRIP ANALYTICS & PERSONAL PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS (In Progress)

**Roadmap:** 11A Analytics Domain → 11B Historical Aggregation → 11C Dashboard
→ 11D Activity Breakdown → 11E Trends → 11F Personal Records → 11G UX Refinement
→ 11H Performance/Security/Accessibility/QA

### 11A — Analytics Domain (Complete)

**Commit:** `4f698b0` `feat: implement trip analytics domain`
**Also:** `304505e` `fix: self-host Inter font to remove build-time network dependency`

**Session baseline note (forensics):** work resumed from a single baseline
commit (`7bb128e`) containing the full Phase 7–10 codebase. A handoff note
described a partially constructed analytics test file; inspection of the
checkout (git status, branch/remote check, full file listing) found NO
analytics artifacts — the tree was clean with no untracked files. Phase 11A
was therefore built fresh on the verified Phase 7–10 baseline rather than
"repairing" a partial state that did not exist in the repository.

### Architecture (`src/lib/domain/tracking/analytics.ts`)
- **Pure, deterministic aggregation** over normalized `TripActivityRecord`s.
  No I/O, no wall-clock reads: `referenceDate` is explicit, or defaults to
  the latest valid record date in the dataset.
- **Single composition point, zero duplicated math:**
  `tripActivityRecord(trip, points)` consumes the canonical
  `computeRouteStats()` (distance, elapsed time, elevation — Phase 9) and
  `calculateStatistics()` (moving time, same 0.3 m/s moving threshold as
  live tracking — Phase 7). Analytics only sums, averages, and finds maxima
  over those normalized values.
- **Date semantics (documented contract in the module):** windows are UTC
  calendar days. `{days: N}` = [UTC midnight(ref) − (N−1) days, UTC midnight
  of the day after ref) — start midnight INCLUSIVE, next-day midnight
  EXCLUSIVE. Future dates and missing/invalid dates are excluded from every
  windowed result but included in `'all'` results. No local-timezone
  involvement anywhere.
- **Trip reference date** (which date a trip "happened" on):
  `endDate → startDate → plannedDate → createdAt` — real fields only.
- **API:** `computeTripAnalytics` (status counts incl. cancelled,
  distance/elapsed/moving totals, elevation totals, `hasElevation` honesty
  flag, averages over trips WITH routes, personal records linked to source
  trip), `summarizeByActivity` (only activity types present, stable domain
  order), `buildTrendSeries` (contiguous zero-filled day/week/month buckets,
  ISO Monday weeks, deterministic default granularity per window),
  `resolveWindow` / `filterByWindow` / `tripReferenceDate` /
  `latestRecordDate` / `utcDayStart` / `emptyTripAnalytics`.
- **Records:** longest distance, largest ascent (>0 required), highest
  elevation (0 m accepted as real data, null when no altitude), longest
  moving time (>0 required). Ties resolve to first record in input order
  (documented; callers pass stable order).

### Tests (58 new; suite total 168/168)
Empty dataset; single trip; multiple trips; distance/elapsed/elevation
totals; averages (incl. null case); 7/30/90/365-day and all-time windows;
exact boundaries (start-midnight included, 1 ms before excluded,
end-midnight excluded); UTC-vs-local-timezone boundary behavior; future
dates; invalid and missing dates; default reference-date determinism;
RangeError on invalid windows/reference dates; exact bound values; activity
grouping (stable order, window drops); all four personal records incl. tie
and zero/sea-level edge cases; trend buckets (day/week/month, zero-fill,
default granularity, invalid-date exclusion); adapter cross-checked against
the canonical functions (incl. stationary routes, altitude-0 handling);
full pipeline over six realistic Trip + recorded-point fixtures; input-order
independence of totals. Real project types throughout; no `any`.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors (17 pre-existing warnings, none in new files)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — pass
- `npx vitest run` — 168/168 pass
- `npm run build` — pass
- Secrets scan on changed files — clean

### Build fix in the same session (`304505e`)
`next/font/google` fetched Inter from fonts.googleapis.com at build time,
which breaks builds in network-restricted environments. The variable Inter
latin subset (wght 100–900, SIL OFL) is now committed under
`src/app/fonts/` and loaded via `next/font/local` — builds are fully
deterministic and no longer depend on a third-party CDN.

### Known limitations (11A)
- Domain only: no data access or UI yet (11B/11C).
- Historical moving time is computed in TypeScript from stored route points
  (11B defines the data path). Deliberately NO SQL re-implementation of the
  Haversine/elevation math — one implementation per rule.
- No cross-trip average speed metric (per-trip speed remains on the route
  page); aggregates stay honest (time and distance totals instead).

### 11B: Historical aggregation (server-side) — `2ab9fb9`
`src/lib/domain/tracking/analyticsService.ts` adds the server-only data
path. `TripAnalyticsService.getTripActivityRecords()`:
- Resolves the authenticated user via the server client (no service-role
  key anywhere; the browser keeps only the anon key).
- Loads every trip through the existing `TripService` (RLS-scoped) and all
  route points in ONE bulk query via `.in('trip_id', ids)` — no per-trip
  N+1, and raw points never reach the browser.
- Groups points by trip and maps them through the 11A domain functions
  (`computeRouteStats` + `calculateStatistics`) into `TripActivityRecord`.
- No schema, RLS or index changes; per-user isolation is guaranteed by RLS
  (ownership) plus explicit `user_id` filters.

Pure, unit-tested helpers are extracted: `groupRoutePointsByTrip`,
`buildActivityRecords` (tested in `analyticsService.test.ts`).

### 11C: Dashboard field log — `021cdbd`
- `src/app/page.tsx` becomes the "Expedition Log": primary metrics are
  Total distance, Completed trips, Elevation gained, Moving time — all
  computed from recorded routes only; an em dash plus "no altitude data"
  is shown when no route has altitude (never a fabricated zero).
- `WindowSelector` (7/30/90/365 days / all time) is a set of plain links
  driven by the `?window=` search param — no client-side state, fully
  keyboard accessible, works without JavaScript interactivity.
- Historical-context line: status counts, average recorded trip, longest
  trip with a link — only clauses backed by real data are rendered.
- Honest empty state for users without trips.
- SSR tests (`page.test.tsx`) use React 19 `renderToReadableStream`
  (the page is an async server component; the legacy synchronous API
  cannot represent it).

### 11D + 11E + 11F: Breakdown, trend, personal records — `7616c8e`
- Activity breakdown (`ActivityBreakdown`): dense table, only activity
  types that actually have trips; per-row recorded count; ascent "—"
  unless the activity has real altitude data.
- Distance trend (`DistanceTrendChart`): dependency-free SVG bar chart
  (no chart library added). Buckets come from the domain
  `buildTrendSeries` — contiguous, zero-filled, day/week/month
  resolution chosen by window; accessible `role="img"` spoken summary
  plus a full screen-reader data table. Honest empty state when the
  window has no recorded distance.
- Personal records (`PersonalRecords`): all-time, never windowed —
  longest distance, largest ascent, highest elevation, longest moving
  time — each linked to its source trip. Records without qualifying real
  data are omitted entirely. Imported GPX routes are treated exactly
  like live tracking (same stored route points, no special-casing;
  documented in the service).
- Page tests extended to 6 SSR smoke tests: windowed values,
  no-altitude honesty, record omission, record links, empty user.

### 11G + 11H: Refinement and QA — `123ecfc`
- Performance: the dashboard fetches the user's trips ONCE and passes the
  list into `TripAnalyticsService` (new optional parameter) instead of
  issuing a second identical query for recent adventures; all analytics
  math runs server-side per render (O(trips + points), no per-render
  client work, no big chart node counts — fixed-size SVG).
- Robustness: malformed `?window=` values now fall back to the 30-day
  label consistently (label derives from the parsed window).
- Accessibility/robustness fix in the Phase 10
  `ElevationProfileChart`: theme tokens (HSL triplets) were used as bare
  SVG colors — invalid values that silently rendered black. The panel is
  a fixed light "paper map" surface and now uses explicit colors with
  stable contrast (low/high labels at slate-600). Audit confirms no raw
  theme-token color usages remain in TS/TSX; chart data is always
  duplicated in a screen-reader table.
- Mobile: analysis grid stacks below `lg`; the activity table hides the
  recorded-count nuance below `sm` to keep four columns without wrapping.

## QA gate at `123ecfc`
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
- `npx vitest run` — 15 files, 180/180 tests passing
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors (16 pre-existing warnings, unchanged set)
- `npm run build` — clean
- Secrets scan on changed files — clean

**Phase 11 status:** complete (11A–11H). All analytics values derive from
recorded route data; no fabricated metrics, no chart-wall UI, no
service-role exposure.

## PHASE 12A — SECURITY AND SCHEMA CORRECTNESS (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-09-06

**Implementation commit:** `d523c6952d9e72e62a4fa377d93b86528ab98701` — `feat: harden database security and schema constraints`

**Remote checkpoint:** merged through PR #2; `origin/main` reached `9280d0a76af369f2cc8dbac09754d5f96c98b988`

### Findings remediated

- Removed `.env.local` from the tracked tree without deleting the developer's
  ignored local copy. `.gitignore` now excludes every `.env.*` file except the
  redacted `.env.example`. Historical environment-file commits remain public,
  so previously exposed Supabase credentials must be rotated; history was not
  destructively rewritten.
- Fixed the critical `trip_packing_items` gap: all five application tables now
  enable RLS, revoke table privileges from `anon`, and define explicit
  `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` policies scoped to `authenticated`.
  Child-table ownership resolves through the owning trip or gear template;
  update policies include both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`.
- Replaced the non-reproducible migration chain with an authoritative baseline.
  The historical `0001_tracking_phase7.sql` version/name is retained for
  existing migration histories but now creates the complete fresh schema.
  `0002_gear_system.sql` is duplicate-safe, and
  `20260906000100_phase12a_security_hardening.sql` is the forward migration for
  existing databases. `schema.sql` is a validated snapshot, not an upgrade
  script.
- Added database checks for nonblank/practical text lengths, enum values,
  nonnegative finite estimates and gear weight, trip date order, coordinate
  ranges, finite elevation, nonnegative finite accuracy, source identifiers,
  quantity limits, and packing-state consistency. Elevation and weight values
  of zero remain valid.
- Existing installations receive the new CHECK constraints as `NOT VALID`.
  They protect new writes immediately without clamping, deleting, or inventing
  legacy GPS measurements. Operators must inspect and validate legacy rows
  after deployment.
- Added the database uniqueness invariant `(trip_id, source_item_id)`. NULL
  source IDs remain distinct, so legitimate ad-hoc duplicate items are allowed.
  Legacy duplicate snapshots are preserved and detached from duplicate
  provenance; no item row is deleted. Assignment now uses conflict-safe upsert
  semantics for concurrent requests.
- Added `route_points.source_id` to Row/Insert/Update TypeScript contracts,
  relationship metadata, and typed browser/server Supabase clients.
- Replaced truthiness-based numeric mappings with nullish semantics for route
  elevation/accuracy, trip estimates, and gear weight. Status-only trip updates
  now map only supplied fields and cannot erase existing trip data.
- Migrated the deprecated middleware convention to the Next.js 16 proxy and
  made dashboard, trip, and gear routes fail closed with a login redirect.
  Login, signup, and the authentication callback remain public. `/gear` is
  explicitly dynamic so cookie access is not swallowed during prerendering.
- Added CSP, referrer policy, permissions policy, content-type protection,
  frame protection, production HSTS, and framework-header removal. CSP permits
  only the current Supabase and OpenStreetMap integrations; inline scripts and
  styles remain necessary for the current Next.js/Leaflet architecture.

### Verification tooling

- `npm run db:validate` checks baseline/snapshot drift, unique migration
  versions, all table RLS enables, all 20 authenticated policy operations,
  anonymous privilege revocation, named integrity constraints, assignment
  uniqueness, migration safety markers, and `source_id` type alignment.
- `npm run security:scan` scans tracked files for credential signatures without
  printing matched values and warns about historical environment commits.
- `supabase/verification/phase12a_production_checks.sql` performs read-only
  hosted checks for RLS flags, policy roles/commands, anonymous privileges,
  constraint validation state, and the packing uniqueness index.

### Validation at `d523c69`

- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 14 pre-existing warnings
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — pass
- `npx vitest run` — 19 files, 201/201 tests pass
- `npm run build` — pass; no deprecated middleware or dynamic-usage warning
- `npm audit` — 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run db:validate` — pass
- `npm run security:scan` — pass for 107 tracked files
- Production runtime smoke check — protected `/`, `/trips`, `/trips/new`, and
  `/gear` return login redirects; public auth routes remain reachable; security
  headers are present and `X-Powered-By` is absent

### External limitation / production action

The configured Supabase hostname did not resolve during the audit. No migration
was applied to a hosted database and no live RLS result is claimed. Before a
production release, rotate historical credentials, apply the authoritative
migration chain to the intended project, run the read-only production checks,
remediate any invalid legacy records deliberately, and validate every pending
constraint. Static schema checks supplement but do not replace that gate.

**Phase 12A status:** implementation and repository validation complete.

## PHASE 12B — TRIP RELIABILITY & JOURNEY HARDENING (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-09-06

**Implementation commit:** `85cb6a3` — `feat: harden trip update, lifecycle, editing, filtering and boundaries`

**Remote checkpoint:** `origin/arena/01a07392-trailmate` at `85cb6a3`; PR to `main` pending merge

### Scope delivered (12B-1 → 12B-9)

**12B-1 Trip update correctness:**
- `tripUpdatesToDatabase()` already maps only supplied keys; validated that `status`-only, `title`-only, `activity`-only, `date`-only, `visibility`-only, numeric `0`, and `null` vs `undefined` vs `""` are all distinguished. No default invention for omitted fields. Added `src/lib/domain/trips/update.test.ts` (11 tests) covering all important cases.

**12B-2 Trip lifecycle / state transitions + dates:**
- New `src/lib/domain/trips/lifecycle.ts`: explicit `canTransition`/`assertCanTransition`/`lifecycleDatesForTransition`/`transitionWithDates`. Allowed: `planned→active`, `planned→cancelled`, `active→completed`, `active→cancelled`; all other transitions rejected including no-ops and `planned→completed`. `TripService.updateTrip` now fetches current row, validates transition, and auto-sets `start_date` (planned→active) and `end_date` (active→completed) only when the caller did not explicitly supply the date, preserving all unrelated fields. Convenience `startTrip()`/`completeTrip()` added. GPS tracker page (`/trips/[id]/track`) auto-activates a `planned` trip when opened so tracking and lifecycle agree. Tests in `lifecycle.test.ts` (11 tests) + `journey.test.ts` (9 tests).

**12B-3 Activity validation consistency:**
- One authoritative set: `VALID_ACTIVITY_TYPES = ['trekking','cycling','camping','other']` in `src/lib/domain/trips/validation.ts`. The same set is used by `isActivityType()`, `validateTripInput()`, `TripService.createTrip`/`updateTrip` (server-side), `analytics ACTIVITY_TYPE_ORDER`, filtering, and the DB `CHECK (activity_type IN (...))`. Removed the mismatched `hiking` option from `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx` and added server-side validation on every create/update. Tests in `validation.test.ts` (12 tests).

**12B-4 Server actions + redirect correctness:**
- Audited `create`/`update`/`start`/`complete`/`delete` in `src/app/trips/new/page.tsx` and `src/app/trips/[id]/page.tsx` + `edit/page.tsx` + `track/page.tsx`. Redirects (`redirect('/trips')`) are now *outside* the inner `try/catch` that handles service errors, and every catch explicitly re-throws `NEXT_REDIRECT` (checked via `digest.startsWith('NEXT_REDIRECT')`) so Next.js control flow is never swallowed. Added `redirect.test.ts` (2 tests) for the pattern.

**12B-5 Trip editing:**
- Implemented `src/app/trips/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (`export const dynamic='force-dynamic'`): loads existing trip via `TripService.getTripById`, pre-fills all editable fields (title, activity, description, plannedDate, estimatedDistance/Elevation/Duration, difficulty, visibility), validates with `validateTripInput`, maps empty strings to `null` (clear) and `"0"` to `0`, preserves unrelated data via `tripUpdatesToDatabase`, enforces ownership (via service `user_id` filter) and lifecycle (edit form does not expose status; status changes only via lifecycle actions), returns to `/trips/[id]` on success, shows validation errors, works on mobile. Edit control on detail page now links to this route with accessible `aria-label`.

**12B-6 Safe deletion confirmation:**
- New client component `src/components/trips/DeleteTripButton.tsx`: two-stage destructive dialog with clear explanation, `Confirm`/`Cancel` buttons, loading state (`Deleting…`), failure state (`role="alert"`), `Escape` to close, `Cancel` focused initially, `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal` + `aria-labelledby/describedby`, no accidental deletion (requires explicit confirm). Successful deletion redirects to `/trips`. Integrated into detail page replacing the bare form submit.

**12B-7 URL-driven filtering:**
- `src/app/trips/page.tsx` now `export const dynamic='force-dynamic'` and `searchParams: Promise<...>` (Next.js 16). Server-validated filtering: only `status` in `['planned','active','completed','cancelled']` and `activity` in the authoritative set participate; invalid values are dropped, not errored. Filter UI is a real `GET` form (`role="search"`), with `search`/`status`/`activity` inputs, `Filter` submit and `Clear` link (`/trips`) that removes query, deterministic, refresh-safe, shareable, no duplicate params, unrelated params preserved via normal GET semantics. Added `filtering.test.ts` (7 tests).

**12B-8 Loading / error / not-found boundaries:**
- Added `src/app/trips/loading.tsx`, `src/app/trips/error.tsx` (client, logs and `Try again`/`Back`), `src/app/trips/[id]/loading.tsx`, `src/app/trips/[id]/error.tsx`, `src/app/trips/[id]/not-found.tsx` (friendly, no internal detail leak, `Back to trips`/`Create a trip`). Detail page now uses `notFound()` for missing/ownership miss instead of silent `redirect('/trips')`; protected routes still `redirect('/login')` when unauthenticated.

**12B-9 Full journey tests:**
- New deterministic suite: `validation.test.ts` 12, `lifecycle.test.ts` 11, `update.test.ts` 11, `filtering.test.ts` 7, `journey.test.ts` 9, `redirect.test.ts` 2. Journey tests cover load existing values, valid/invalid updates, ownership contract, status-only preservation, zero/nullable handling, full `planned→active→completed` with dates, repeated/invalid transitions, activity consistency. No existing tests deleted.

**Directly-related accessibility:**
- All new filter inputs have associated `<label>` (`sr-only` where visual label would duplicate), `aria-label`/`aria-describedby`, `role="search"` on filter, `role="dialog"` + focus on cancel for delete, `aria-label` on Start/Edit/Delete/Complete buttons with trip title, `aria-label` on edit form fields, no `Link` inside `Button` nesting (uses `Button href`), status not only via color (text + Badge variant), destructive action explicit. Edit page labels all associated.

**Directly-related performance:**
- `getAllTrips` once + in-memory filter for `/trips`; edit/detail load only the single trip (plus packing progress for card); no new duplicate queries introduced. `getFilteredTrips` helper exists for reuse without extra DB round-trips.

### Validation at `85cb6a3`

- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings (gear page unused `templateId`/`CardDescription`, persistence `TrackingSession`, sync `error`)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — pass
- `npx vitest run` — 25 files, 253/253 tests pass (52 new)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL/DUMMY npm run build` — pass (routes include `/trips/[id]/edit`, all trip routes `ƒ` dynamic)
- `npm audit` — 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run db:validate` — pass (122 tracked files)
- `npm run security:scan` — pass for 122 tracked files (historical env-commit warning remains expected)
- `git diff --check` — clean

### Known limitations (12B)

- Offline trip mutations still require connectivity; no offline queue for trips.
- No bulk trip operations or trip sharing UI.
- Production DB still requires hosted `phase12a_production_checks.sql` run and constraint validation after migration.
- `trip_packing_items` uniqueness and elevation handling unchanged (12A).

**Phase 12B status:** complete (12B-1 → 12B-9). No Phase 12C work has started.

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-06
**Current Phase:** Phase 12B - Trip Reliability & Journey Hardening (Complete)
**Latest Implementation Commit:** 85cb6a315c84d7396ec10cfeb637ddc6dcc111b2

## PHASE 12C / V1 — CHECKPOINT 1: USER-SCOPED LOCAL STORAGE (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-09-06
**Merge commit (main):** `9de640a` — `feat: scope local tracking storage per user with durable v2 migration (#5)`
**PR:** #5

### Scope delivered

- IndexedDB v2 (`DB_VERSION = 2`): sessions and points carry an owning `userId`; by-user index on sessions, by-trip/by-session/by-queue indexes on points.
- Unsynced queue derived from a string `queueKey` (`<userId>:0|1`) instead of the v1 `pending` store: a point and its queue membership are now a single atomic write (booleans are not valid IndexedDB keys).
- One-time legacy migration: v1 records without a user id are stamped under the account that first opens the upgraded store (`meta.legacyMigratedFor`); the v1 `pending` store is dropped during upgrade.
- Quarantine support: points whose trip no longer exists are retired with a reason and excluded from sync without deleting raw data.
- `TrackingStore.deletePointsByTrip` plus `clearLocalTripData` wired into the delete-trip flow; per-user `clearUserData` for safe local reset.
- `useTracking` now requires the owning `userId` (passed from the server-rendered track page), tears down engines/storage on account change, and refuses to mount without an account.
- Adapter perf: `getAllByIndex` uses the native `index.getAll` request instead of cursor stepping (validated at 5000 points).

### Validation

- `npx vitest run` — 25 files, 260/260 pass (7 new)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — pass
- `npm run security:scan` — pass (124 tracked files)
- secret/attribution scans clean; no prohibited strings in commit or diff
- Working tree clean after merge; `origin/main == 9de640a`


## PHASE 12C / V1 — CHECKPOINT 2: SYNC STATE MACHINE + RECOVERY (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-09-06
**Merge commit (main):** `a990939` — `feat: deterministic sync state machine with retry, drain and quarantine (#6)`
**PR:** #6

### Scope delivered

- Sync states: local, queued, syncing, retrying, synced, failed (paused) — UI labels only states the engine reports.
- Bounded jittered exponential backoff (2s→60s) with an 8-attempt consecutive-failure cap: after the cap the engine pauses and requires an explicit retry; no hidden retry loop.
- Automatic queue drain in bounded steps (batch size 200, 250ms between steps) so large backlogs finish without blocking the UI; drains until empty.
- Partial batch failure isolation: data-class failures are split recursively to the individual point and quarantined (raw data preserved), so one stale record cannot poison a queue.
- Uploader classifies network/auth/data failures and verifies batch ownership against the current session.
- Persisted `session.syncState` follows the engine (`SET_SYNC`) and `persistenceState` records successful saves (`SET_PERSISTED`).
- GPS error recovery: retry resumes the SAME session (no orphaned sessions); fixes are only accepted in reducible states.
- Lint: 0 errors / 0 warnings (cleared all pre-existing warnings).
- Tests: 264 passing (11 new across storage/sync suites).


## PHASE 12C / V1 — CHECKPOINT 3: OFFLINE COMPLETION RECONCILIATION (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-09-06
**Merge commit (main):** `ca92e7e` — `feat: offline trip completion reconciliation (#7)`
**PR:** #7

### Scope delivered

- `finish()` is two-phase: local completion (points durable, engine keeps draining) then a server transition via `finishTripAction`.
- Durable per-user `CompletionIntent` persisted before the server call; removed only on success.
- Track page initialization reconciles any pending intent before resuming sessions, so offline finishes recover after refresh/restart.
- Retry-finish UI when offline/auth fails; `retryCompletion` exposed from the hook; sign-in errors surfaced as readable alerts.
- Idempotent reconciliation: completing an already-completed trip is treated as success.
- Session sync/durability state persisted truthfully (`SET_SYNC`, `SET_PERSISTED`) with reducer tests.
- Tests: 267 passing (25 files). Lint clean; typecheck clean.

## PHASE 12D — CI & E2E CHECKPOINT (In Progress)

**Date:** 2026-09-06

**Handoff forensics (discrepancy recorded):** The handoff instructed resuming from
local commit `b44b6c3` and pushing "the existing CI + E2E checkpoint". Verification
against the repository found **no such commit or work**:
- `origin/main` = `caf5d469df21345bf15a3fe493c7e029a133dd84` (PR #9 tip).
- The Arena branch `arena/01a075ef-trailmate` was local-only, never pushed, clean,
  and byte-identical to `origin/main` (empty diff).
- `b44b6c3` is not a valid object anywhere: `git rev-list --all` (after unshallowing
  the depth-1 clone and fetching every `refs/heads/*`), the reflog, `git fsck`
  dangling objects, and a full-filesystem grep all returned nothing.
- No `.github/` directory, no Playwright/Cypress config, no `e2e/` files, and no
  CI/E2E scripts existed in `package.json`. The architecture doc lists Playwright
  E2E and a CI/CD pipeline only as *planned* Phase 10–11 work.

Per owner decision, the CI + E2E checkpoint was built fresh on the verified
baseline rather than racing a phantom handoff.

### Scope delivered

**CI (`/github/workflows/ci.yml`)** — runs on push to `main`/`arena/**` and PRs:
- `gates` job: `npm ci`, lint, typecheck, `npm test` (vitest), `db:validate`,
  `security:scan`, `npm audit --audit-level=high`, production build (with
  placeholder Supabase creds), `git diff --check`.
- `e2e` job (needs `gates`): installs Playwright Chromium (`--with-deps`), runs
  `npm run e2e`, uploads the Playwright report on failure. caches the browser.

**Playwright E2E suite (`e2e/`)** — targets the unauthenticated surface so CI
needs no live backend:
- `playwright.config.ts`: drives the production server via `npm run e2e:serve`
  (`scripts/e2e/serve.mjs`), waits on `/login`, single Chromium project.
- `scripts/e2e/serve.mjs`: builds once with placeholder Supabase credentials (the
  dashboard's `useAuth` calls `createClient()` at prerender), then starts the
  runtime server **without** them so the auth proxy fails closed to `/login`
  instantly — no external network, fully deterministic.
- `e2e/auth-boundary.spec.ts` (10 tests): `/login` and `/signup` render their
  forms and labelled inputs; every protected route (`/`, `/trips`, `/trips/new`,
  `/gear`, `/gear/gear-list`, `/trips/example-trip-id`) redirects to `/login`.
- `e2e/security-headers.spec.ts` (2 tests): CSP, `X-Frame-Options`, content-type,
  referrer and permissions headers present on pages and on the 307 redirect;
  `X-Powered-By` absent; CSP allows only the configured integrations.

**Files added:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `e2e/auth-boundary.spec.ts`,
`e2e/security-headers.spec.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `scripts/e2e/serve.mjs`;
`package.json` (`@playwright/test`, `e2e`/`e2e:ui`/`e2e:serve` scripts);
`.gitignore` (Playwright artifacts); `package-lock.json`.

### Validation (repository gates — all pass locally)

- `npm run lint` — 0 errors
- `npm run typecheck` — pass
- `npm test` — 27 files, 286/286 tests pass
- `npm run db:validate` — pass
- `npm run security:scan` — pass (137 tracked files; historical env-commit warning
  remains expected)
- `npm audit` — 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run build` — pass (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=… ANON_KEY=…`)
- `git diff --check` — clean
- `npx playwright test --list` — 12 tests discovered across 2 files
- `scripts/e2e/serve.mjs` — verified: starts Next on the configured port, `/login`
  returns 200 with "Welcome Back", `/` returns 307 → `/login`

### Remote checkpoint

- Pushed to `origin/arena/01a075ef-trailmate` at commit
  `6de81e86642204ab00bb604cfaff7521d364fe91` (code + E2E suite). Remote SHA
  verified against local HEAD.

### Known limitation / external action

- The E2E **browser** step was not executed locally: the sandbox blocks the
  Chromium download hosts (`cdn.playwright.dev`, `storage.googleapis.com`,
  auxiliary mirrors) and the apt mirrors needed for Chromium's runtime libraries
  (`libnspr4`/`libnss3`). DOM assertions were grounded against the served SSR
  HTML (headings, input ids, `label[for]`, `href` targets), and the server launcher
  was exercised directly. The browser suite is the authoritative gate that runs in
  CI once the workflow is live.
- **Workflow push blocked:** GitHub rejected pushing `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  because the Arena GitHub App token lacks the `workflows` permission
  ("refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow … without
  `workflows` permission"). The CI file is present in the working tree
  (untracked) and ready to commit/push once the `workflows` permission is granted
  to the integration (repo settings → GitHub App → Content + Workflows).

**Phase 12D status:** E2E code checkpoint pushed and SHA-verified. CI workflow
push pending the `workflows` GitHub App permission; browser E2E executes in CI.
